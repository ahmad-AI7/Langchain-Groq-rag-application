# Langchain-Groq-rag-application
This project builds a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering questions over documents. Using LangChain, Groq (LLM), HuggingFace (embeddings), and Chroma (vector storage), it enables users to query documents and receive accurate, context-based answers.
